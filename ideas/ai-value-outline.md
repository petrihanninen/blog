# Where Do You Fit When AI Does the Thinking?

## Hook
- AI is no longer just automating grunt work and boilerplate, it's encroaching on creativity, complex reasoning and judgment
- The question you need to answer: where do *you* add value?

## The "You are a shitty UI" Problem
- If you're just passing prompts and relaying outputs, you're a middleman
- You become a degraded interface between the user and the model
- Anyone can do that. Soon, no one will need to.

## Find Your Intersection (The AI-Age Ikigai)
- What do you genuinely enjoy doing?
- What can you do that adds value *on top of* what AI produces?
- The overlap is your zone—cultivate it aggressively
- Examples: taste, domain expertise, relationship-building, risk judgment, ethical reasoning, understanding the *why* behind decisions

## The Timeline Trap
- Today you might feel safe. The work still requires you. But look 2, 5 or 10 years down the road, and things will change.
- I'm not super bullish on AI, but even so, job security isn't guaranteed
- Waiting until you're at the shortlist of people who can't be replaced is a recipe for disaster

## The Uncomfortable Truth
- If you can't articulate what you uniquely bring to the table, your manager can't either.
- That realization might come from your manager before it comes from you
- Better to confront this now, on your own terms

## Closing
- This isn't doom—it's clarity
- Defining your value is empowering, not limiting
- The people who thrive will be those who figured this out early

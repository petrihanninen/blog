lede: A cool way of taking notes on the go I'm testing out.
---

I just stumbled into a pretty cool workflow for taking notes: Take a voice memo, ramble around as much as you like, grab the transcript and ask an LLM tool to summarize the mess into something more coherent. This can be pretty easily automated: Use _something_ to record your voice, to transcribe it, to summarize it and to store it.

My approach outlined below is very much an Apple Ecosystem way of doing it. But these steps can be easily adapted to other platforms, software etc.

1. Record: We can use Voice Memos app to record the musings.
2. Transcribe: You can grab the memo transcript from the Voice Memos.
3. Summarize: Out of habit I use ChatGPT for pretty much everything, so just copypasta your transcript into ChatGPT for summarizing.
4. Store: Send the note to Apple Notes

I felt that the summaries could be a bit all over the place with just posting the transcript to ChatGPT. To improve the results, you can use an additional prompt that you can prepend to the transcription. What I have atm is:

> Summarize the following transcription of a voice note.
> Write the summary from the first person (eg I think that … instead of speaker thinks …)

The first person bullet especially is quite significant for preserving my sanity. Your mileage and preferences probably will be different to mine, and the prompt can be modified accordingly.

To make this into a nicer workflow, you can use the Shortcuts app. This approach is quite heavily copied from Creator Magic's great [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fk4M_63rug). To prepend the prompt, what I did was add a "Text" step with the contents of the prompt, "List" step with first item being the text step and second item the transcibed audio and finally "Combine" step that grabs the list and combines the contents with new lines. This could probably be improved (maybe have the prompt in a note or utilize some custom GPT type of deal?), but it seems to work fine for now.

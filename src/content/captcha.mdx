This is just a note to self.

If you need captcha, rewatch Theo's [video](https://youtu.be/SasXJwyKkMI?si=c0eeWWrL3HAtPYdw). Probably use [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) for at least anything that's not absolutely huge or otherwise valuable/critical. Maybe could look into [Radar by WorkOs](https://workos.com/radar).

title: I Built a Workout App in 3 Hours with Claude

lede: The economics of building software just changed. Here's what that actually looks like.

I've been meaning to build a simple workout tracker for months. Nothing fancy—just something to log my lifts and see progress over time. Every time I thought about it, I'd do the mental math: a weekend or two of coding, deployment setup, database schema design... and then I'd decide it wasn't worth the time investment for something so personal.

Last week I finally built it. It took about three hours. Here's how.

## The Process

I didn't just open Claude and start prompting. That's the vibe coding equivalent of sitting down to write code without knowing what you're building. Instead, I started with a spec file.

**Step 1: Create a `spec.md` file**

Before touching any code, I wrote out what I actually wanted. Not in Claude's chat UI—in a proper markdown file I could edit and refine. The chat UI is a pain in the ass for anything longer than a few sentences. You can't easily restructure, you miss things, and you end up with a sprawling mess of clarifications.

A spec file forces you to think through the whole thing upfront. Mine was pretty bare-bones since this was a personal tool with zero stakes:

- Track exercises, sets, reps, weight
- See history for each exercise
- Mobile-friendly UI
- Postgres database (I have a homelab k8s cluster to deploy to)

**Step 2: Let Claude interrogate the spec**

This is where it gets interesting. I asked Claude to review my spec and ask clarifying questions. Not to implement—just to poke holes.

It asked about user authentication (do I need it if it's just for me?), data export, whether I wanted suggested progressions, rest timer features. Some questions I hadn't considered. Others helped me realize features I thought I wanted but actually didn't.

**Step 3: Plan, then implement**

With a tighter spec, I asked Claude to plan the implementation. It suggested the file structure, database schema, and component breakdown. Only after I approved the plan did I let it start writing code.

This is the unsexy secret of vibe coding: the planning phase matters more than the prompting tricks.

## Where Things Went Wrong

Let's be real—it wasn't all smooth sailing.

**I poisoned my own spec.** I added "Next.js" to the requirements out of habit. Claude asked clarifying questions about other parts of the spec, but it didn't push back on my tech choices. For a personal throwaway project, that's probably fine. But if you're building something that matters, you need to actively prompt Claude to be more critical. Something like: "Question my assumptions. If there's a simpler approach, tell me."

**Outdated dependencies.** Prisma setup hit errors because Claude was working from outdated version formats. This is a known limitation—its training data has a cutoff. My fix: add a note to my global `claude.md` that it should check latest versions before installing dependencies. It's not perfect, but it helps.

**No automatic quality checks.** Claude didn't run linting or type checking when it finished. The code had errors that would've been caught by a simple `pnpm check`. The solution is simple: add "always run linting and type checking before considering a task complete" to your project instructions.

**File conflicts.** When I ran `create-next-app`, it clashed with my existing `spec.md` and `readme.md`. Minor annoyance, easy fix—put planning docs in a `plan/` or `tmp/` directory instead.

## So Did It Work?

Yes. Unambiguously yes.

Is the result perfect? No. The UI has some dumb decisions I'd change if I were doing it by hand. Pixel-pushing through prompts is tedious compared to just editing CSS yourself.

But here's the thing: **I actually built it.**

The calculation changed. Three hours for a working app I'll use daily? That's worth it. Two weekends of careful craftsmanship for the same thing? Hard pass—I've got other shit to do.

This is the real unlock with AI-assisted development. It's not that you suddenly build better software. It's that the time-vs-value equation shifts. Projects that weren't worth the investment suddenly become viable. Ideas that would've stayed in a notes app actually get built.

## What I'd Do Differently

For this low-stakes project, the rough edges don't matter. But if I were building something more serious:

1. **Write a proper spec with sections.** Force yourself to cover all the bases—auth, data model, edge cases, deployment.

2. **Prompt for skepticism.** Tell Claude to question your decisions, not just execute them.

3. **Set up guardrails in `claude.md`.** Type checking, linting, version verification—make them automatic.

4. **Keep planning docs separate.** Use a dedicated directory so they don't conflict with generated files.

The tools are there. The productivity gains are real. You just need to be intentional about how you use them.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have some deadlifts to log.

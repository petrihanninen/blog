title: Take Ownership of Your Slop

AI tools are everywhere now. They write our emails, generate our code, draft our documentation, and summarize our meetings. There is productivity gains are real. But so is the flood of half-baked, unreviewed garbage that's clogging up our inboxes and pull requests.

Let me state the obvious: No matter if you write the thing yourself, use AI, copypaste from Stack Overflow or use a Ouija board to generate your output, YOU are the one responsible for the quality. For every single paragraph, word and em dash.

### You Own It, Full Stop

The tool doesn't take responsibility. ChatGPT won't apologize to your colleague for the confusing Slack message. Claude won't be the one losing sleep when your piece of crap code breaks prod in the middle of the night. You are. Or even worse, somebody else has to clean up after your neglicence.

This should be obvious, but apparently it isn't. I've seen pull requests with AI-generated descriptions that don't match what the code actually does. Messages that are technically grammatical but communicate nothing. Documentation that sounds authoritative but is plain wrong.

You need to own your output. You need to review it. You need to make it yours.

### The Hidden Cost of Slop

Here's where the productivity math breaks down completely.

Say you save 5 minutes by having AI generate a PR description instead of writing it yourself. Great. But if that description is vague or inaccurate, your reviewer now spends 15 minutes trying to decipher what it is you were actually trying to accomplish. Maybe they leave comments asking for clarification.

You saved 5 minutes. You cost someone else 15. Multiply this across a team and those individual shortcuts turn into hours of wasted time.

Pull requests inheretntly invite such back and forth. But by not making the best attempt at producing the best quality you can, you significantly increase the amount of work a PR generates for the reviewer.

And it gets worse. When people consistently receive low-quality communication from you, they stop trusting it. They start skimming your messages. They assume your documentation is probably wrong. Your credibility erodes, and that's much harder to rebuild than the few minutes you saved.

The productivity gains turn into a loss of both productivity and credibility.

### How to Actually Capture the Gains

The solution isn't to stop using AI. The solution is to own your output.

AI can be genuinely great for things you struggle with. No matter if your biggest struggle is staring at a blank page, fixing grammatical issues in the final product or anything in between, these tools can give a big boost.

But you need to ensure your work is the best quality YOU can produce. Not just the best quality the latest LLM can produce.

### The Bottom Line

Using AI responsibly means you understand your tools, you put in the necessary effort to produce quality and you respect the people who have to read your output.

Wheter or not you're using AI to produce something, own it. Review it. Make it yours. Otherwise, you're not being more productive. You're just a shitty UI for ChatGPT.

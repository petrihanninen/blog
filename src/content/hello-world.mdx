Hi you! I'm Petri and I am a Software Developer among other things. I currently work at [Duunitori](https://duunitori.fi) as a developer. There I try to build the best experience for those who look for a job and those who are in a need of somebody to do something as well as enable our whole software engineer team to do the same.

I figured that I'd start writing and publishing some notes of mine. I will definitely not be keeping a strict schedule nor otherwise guarantee anything on this site. You could expect something interesting and I might deliver, or you could not, or I might not. Either way, we'll both be suprised.

The general idea is for the posts to be less like complete, coherent write-ups and more like living documents that get appended, edited, changed or otherwise modified at any time. So something like a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I have a feeling that this post, for example, will be morphing into an "about me" type of deal.

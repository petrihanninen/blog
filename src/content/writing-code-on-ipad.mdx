title: Software Development Setup for Ipad

lede: Carrying a laptop sometimes feels like a chore. This post is an exploration of alternative development environments that utilize an ipad and possibly an external keyboard.

### Why should you want this?

First of all, you probably don't. Small and lightweight laptops hold plenty of umph for simple coding tasks and a proper desktop OS makes life way simpler. That being said, having even more portable setup that can be utilized to jot down a post or a note anywhere seems pretty cool.

### Iteration #1: Github Codespaces on Safari

ATM I'm writing this post and testing this setup. For _just_ writing text / code, this seems to be working quite fine. The setup is pretty much as easy as it gets, if you already have an existing repo: Just navigate to github.com, go to your repo, hit the green button choose Codespaces and rock on. A few hickups are outlined below, and I'll try to tackle them and doocument those solutions or give up trying.

#### 1. Local development environment

It appears that I'm not able access the localhost, even though there's the port forwarding option. It errors with "Unable to forward localhost:4000. The host may not be available or that remote port may already eb forwarded".

#### 2. Keyboard input randomly falls apart

This might have something to do with #1, as the issues happened when trying to do stuff with terminal, ports and write stuff down at the same time.

#### 3. I can't alter the keyboard layout

I use Finnish keyboard with English primarily and especially when writing code and Finnish layout when writing Finnish. This is a quirky workflow that I've developed and probably doesn't concern you. Turns out this was something that needed to be fixed in the Ipad Settings -> Keyboard -> Hardware Keyboard.
